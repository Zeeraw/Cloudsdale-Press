**********************************

### Plain Icon (Black or White)
The black and white icons are to be used against very plain backgrounds where contrast is *key*.
The black icon should be used against a bright background and the white one should be used
against a brightly coloured background, makes sense right? If you want to recolor the black or
the white icon we permit the use of the blue or gray colors specified above **Colors** part of
this readme.

The Cloudsdale Black or White icon **should never**:
* Have a gradient or use two or more different colors
* Have it's shape modified
* Be a color outside our palette
* Have a distinct border

The Cloudsdale Black or White icon **can**:
* Have an inset shadow
* Be used against any background color
